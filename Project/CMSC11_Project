The greedy Panoroganans destroyed the other Panoroganansâ€™ fishing boats along The Great Lake Ranao, killing the men in them. Less powerful Royal Houses joined more powerful ones to protect their family in the generations to come. Soon, the seventeen Panoroganans merged into two what was known as The Great Panoroganans, one lead by the Royal House of DATU A CABUGATAN and the other by the Royal House of BALOI.\nThe PAPANOKA MRA, the legendary bird that guards The Great Lake and provides the life around it, was not happy. For the first time half a century, he has spoken to all the Iranaons. He wanted all the seventeen Houses to be united, ruled by the one true BANTUGAN. Once the two Pangampongs anoint their champions, the two Bantugans will be sent to a journey underneath the Great Lake called the Bathymetris to find the GOLDEN KAMPILAN and the SCARLET KUTYAPI. Whoever comes out as the victor will bring Pat-a-Pangampong-a-Ranao back to its golden age...\n\nGAME START\n\n");
